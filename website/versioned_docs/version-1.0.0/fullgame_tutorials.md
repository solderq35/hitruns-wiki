Specific Strategy Tutorials for fullgame speedrun tutorials

Disclaimer: Not all maps have a tutorial listed here. That may be because we have a shortage of well commentated and knowledgable tutorials for that map, or that said map is not considered particularly difficult.

### Additional Fullgame Resources Listed by Map

- Not all maps have additional resources or tutorials (yet). If none are listed for a particular map, just watch the fullgame run listed [above](#meta-strategies-overview) for a starting point. Also note that some strats listed below may be too risky for a trilogy run and may be better suited for a seasonal run.

#### Hawke's Bay

#### Miami

- [Papier's Miami Video + Text Commentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWAce1vnXzg)

  - You can skip cutscene as soon as the light of Sierra's car go on
    then you walk towards the right corner of the gate (shoot a sieker dart onto the journalist cause she can spot you killing Robert) and shoot through the garage wall when Sierra drives past. You wanna shoot slightly before sierra is in your scope cause she's moving quick. The fake NPC's outside the gate are RNG so ideally you'd have nobody in your way but sometimes you have to adapt where you shoot depending on these NPC's.
    In case you miss sierra you get a second chance once she's around the corner.

  - For Robert I walk to the corner of the blue sign on the ground and aim towards him. You see a black window to his right which is what you want to shoot. You wanna be on the 2nd scope lvl (so 1 more than nothing) and once you see Robert being outside the black part of your sniper scope, you can shoot the wiindow twice.
    Then walk forward along the sign until you see the window next to robert which you wanna shoot after he's walked past. Shoot the bottom right of the window.
    Then you walk further right until you see the gap in the window (you can also step back a bit) and shoot Robert as soon as his head appears.

#### Dubai

- [Dubai 17s Tutorial by Moo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cmZn47I7sY)
  - Probably not consistent enough for trilogy, just good for Season 3 runs
  - See also: [Dubai 16s](https://youtu.be/MB029LdQci8?t=7) (mostly the same but shoot Marcus slightly sooner)
- See the other seasonal (Season 1 / 2 / 3) SASO Pro records [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/full_game) for other faster but riskier strategies.

### Beginner-Friendly(ish) Strats

- [Tsta's 29:36 Trilogy SA/SO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR9otQKNVAw)
  - Some strategies may be riskier for new players, such as Paris, Sapienza, Dartmoor.
- [Solderq35's 37:42 Trilogy SA/SO](https://youtu.be/jHzyLh_Gy8c)
  - Turn on Youtube Subtitles for text commentary.
  - Colorado strategy here is somewhat outdated due to lighting changes, use Tsta's Colorado strategy instead.

Other Beginner Routes to consider:

- [1:27 easy Paris SA/SO alternative](https://youtu.be/U4tb4vn5UbY)
  - Middle ground (in terms of speed and difficulty) compared to the Paris strat shown in the 29:36 and 37:42 trilogy runs.
- [1:44 easy Sapienza](https://youtu.be/TUSgSfCZIe0)
  - Easier virus and Silvio kills
- [2:43 easy Romania](https://youtu.be/4fatU6HntPA)

## SASO Master

Short summary of pro / master differences:

- Longer viewcones
- NPC can hear your footsteps when you trespass
  - Note: Inconsistent mechanic, NPC will react to footsteps at random distances every time
- Some items are moved (moreso on Season 1 than Season 2 or 3)
- Extra guards / enforcers / cameras (moreso on Season 1 than Season 2 or 3)

### Meta Strategies Overview

- [21:49 Run by Hashashin47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0andMCDD8g)
- [Segmented Commentated Run by Aspecticor (23 minutes estimate)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA6mjuBUNfY)
  - Commentary is somewhat surface level, refer to Pro SASO tutorials above for more insight.
- [Segmented "Ideal" Strats by Moodehh (20:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naftsNAnoxw)
  - No commentary. Difficult strats executed to a high level but it shows what is possible on Master SASO full game.
- See the other seasonal (Season 1 / 2 / 3) SASO Master records [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/full_game) for other faster but riskier strategies.

### Additional Fullgame Resources Listed by Map

- Will only list a few videos here for maps where Master really changes. Otherwise, just watch the fullgame run listed [above](#meta-strategies-overview) for a starting point, or refer to the [SASO pro section](#saso-pro).

#### Marrakesh

- [Master Marrakesh Tips by Fusha](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1059614210134388836/1059622392852389938/image.png?width=841&height=670)

#### Romania

## SA Pro / Master

List of maps that can benefit from a disguise for speed and consistency on SA category:

- Paris
- Sapienza
- Colorado (Maybe, needs development)
- Hokkaido
- Santa Fortuna (Speed is comparable to SA/SO but probably safer with disguise)
- Sgail
- New York (Whether this is faster somewhat depends on Athena cycle RNG)
- Dartmoor
- Berlin
- Romania (You'll lose a few seconds getting a disguise but it's arguably worth it for consistency)

### Meta Strategies Overview

- [Yannini 22:02 run](https://youtu.be/DkgcftoZghA)
  - Some strategies outdated, compare with [SASO Pro section above](fullgame_tutorials#saso-pro)
- [Moodehh Season 1 SA 3:31 run](https://youtu.be/vy6sVpPhza8)
- See the other seasonal (Season 1 / 2 / 3) SA Pro records [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/full_game) for other faster but riskier strategies.

## Any%

- For Any% Trilogy, is recommended to compare and contrast the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkbE0_fr3c) and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsUziP-UqMc) place runs, and use the fastest strategies from either.
- See the other seasonal (Season 1 / 2 / 3) Any% records [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/full_game) for other faster but riskier strategies.
