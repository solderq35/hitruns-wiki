## Q: Which version of Hitman 3 / Hitman World of Assassination should I buy, what do the different editions mean?

A: **Short(er) Answer**:

- Option 1: [HITMAN World of Assassination Deluxe Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/963308/)
- Option 2: [HITMAN World of Assassination](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/672746/) + [Hitman 2 Expansion Pass](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1829590/HITMAN_3_Access_Pass_HITMAN_2_Expansion/) + [Hitman 3 - 7 Deadly Sins DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1829587/HITMAN_3__Seven_Deadly_Sins_Collection/)
  - Option 2 is technically missing the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack (not to be confused with "Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack"), but that DLC does not add any unique new items so can be skipped from a speedrunning standpoint
  - As noted below, Option 1 and 2 both are about the same price despite Option 2 missing a minor DLC, due to Option 1 having a default discount. Option 2 is a good option if you want to try out the Hitman WoA standard edition first before buying any DLC
- These 2 options both add up to about $99 USD (with no additional discounts) as of February 2024, and they will get you all of the main campaign missions (the 6 Season 1 missions, 8 Season 2 missions, 6 Season 3 missions), most of the bonus missions, and unique items (from a gameplay standpoint)

**Long Answer**:
As of [January 26, 2023](https://ioi.dk/hitman/news/2023/hitman-3-to-become-world-of-assassination), the main two Hitman 3 / WoA editions are [HITMAN World of Assassination](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/672746/) and [HITMAN World of Assassination Deluxe Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/963308/)

- See [Hitman 3 Steam Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_3/) for any additional / future game editions
- The only difference between the two HITMAN World of Assassination editions is that HITMAN World of Assassination Deluxe Edition also includes:
  - [Hitman 2 Expansion Pass](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1829590/HITMAN_3_Access_Pass_HITMAN_2_Expansion/)
    - Includes "Golden Handshake (New York)" and "The Last Resort (Haven)" main campaign missions / maps. There are some very useful unique unlocks from these maps, notably the Sieker-1 emetic dart gun from Haven
    - Also includes: "Special Assignment" missions (Silver Tongue, Bitter Pill, Illusions of Grandeur, Embrace of the Serpent), Hantu Port and Siberia sniper maps, and some additional cosmetic reskins
  - [Hitman 3 - 7 Deadly Sins DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1829587/HITMAN_3__Seven_Deadly_Sins_Collection/)
    - Some unique (not just cosmetic reskin) items such as Goldbrick Proximity Mine, as well as some new escalation missions
  - [Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1829591/HITMAN_3__Deluxe_Pack/)
    - Director commentary for the season 3 levels of Dubai to Romania, a digital art book, and some cosmetic reskins
    - Not to be confused with the [HITMAN World of Assassination Deluxe Pack](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/30335/HITMAN_World_of_Assassination_Deluxe_Pack/) (which bundles together the three DLC discussed above)
    - If confused, just read the game edition / DLC names again very carefully and read the fine print on the game storefronts on which each DLC includes
- Additional DLC (not necessarily exhaustive):
  - [See Hitman 3 Steam DLC page](https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/1659040/HITMAN_3/) for any additional / future DLC
  - [Sarajevo Six](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475260/HITMAN_3__Sarajevo_Six_Campaign_Pack/): Bonus missions that used to be PlayStation exclusive back in 2016, but are now cross-platform as paid DLC
  - Trinity Pack: Pre-order cosmetic reskins, that can now be obtained by anyone as paid DLC
  - Street Art Pack: Cosmetic reskins
  - Makeshift Pack: Cosmetic reskins
- Example links provided here are for Steam, but the info and game edition / DLC names should be the same for other platforms and mainstream storefronts (Epic, Playstation, Xbox, etc)
  - May also be abbreviated as `HITMAN WOA...` on some storefronts

Other Pointers:

- List of unlocks in the game and how to obtain them: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2725872637
- **Hitman 1 DLC is generally sold at no additional cost within the Hitman WoA game engine, but the same cannot be said for Hitman 2 DLC (Expansion Pass)**
- With that said, Hitman 2 Expansion Pass will still by far give you the best bang for your buck (2 main campaign levels + other bonus missions), then the 7 Deadly Sins for the unlocks, and then the other paid DLC is of subjective value (depending how much you value cosmetic items or arguably lackluster bonus missions)

### Related: If I own Hitman 1 (2016 edition) or Hitman 2 (2018 edition), do I have to buy those levels again?

A: **Short Answer**: You will have to re-purchase the Hitman 2 Expansion Pass to access New York and Haven levels (among other things) to access them within the latest game engine (Hitman 3 / WoA).

**Long Answer**:
Although it used to be possible to obtain all Hitman 1 and 2 content inside of the Hitman 3 / WoA game engine at no added cost, as of [January 26, 2023](https://ioi.dk/hitman/news/2023/hitman-3-to-become-world-of-assassination), this is no longer the case.

### Related: If I own Hitman 1 (2016 edition) or Hitman 2 (2018 edition), can I transfer progress?

A: You can transfer progress from the Hitman 2 (2018 edition) to the Hitman 3 / WoA game engine here: https://profile.hitman.com/

- Hitman 2 and 3 (WoA) must be owned on compatible platforms for this to work, which is explained in guide below
- The "Player Guide" linked has been taken down, but you can see the IOI's new progress carryover guide here: https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019061577-Progression-Carryover-Guide

### Related: What if I want to try out Hitman (2016) or Hitman 2 (2018) in their original game engines?

- A: As of [January 26, 2023](https://ioi.dk/hitman/news/2023/hitman-3-to-become-world-of-assassination), it is no longer possible to buy the original Hitman (2016) or Hitman 2 (2018) game engines / versions, at least not on mainstream storefronts. It is still possible to purchase the 2016 or 2018 edition game CD's (for console) or Steam game keys (for PC) on various retailer or key reseller sites.

Although this wiki is focused on the current HITMAN 3 / WoA (2021) game engine, you can find more information on speedrunning the Hitman (2016) and Hitman 2 (2018 game versions here:

## Q: Do I need to be connected to the Internet at all times to speedrun this game?

A: For Silent Assassin runs, yes for the most part. If you are on PC, you can try [Peacock](https://thepeacockproject.org/wiki/intel/) to bypass IOI's servers. You will need to be connected to Internet for the initial connection, but afterwards you can play offline for the duration of your play session using Peacock. Using either Peacock or connecting to the official servers is required for Silent Assassin runs, as you cannot get to an accurate rating screen otherwise.

Playing offline and without Peacock is allowed for any%, provided you have the in game timer HUD on.

## Q: I don't want to unlock stuff before I speedrun, where is the "New Game"/ "Fresh file" category?

A: The main leaderboards are NG+ by default. There isn't a _true_ New Game speedrun category due to 2 main factors. Firstly, all progress is stored online, and you can only wipe an account's progress every 6 months through IO's website. Secondly, some platforms like Epic Games do not have family sharing built in, meaning it would cost a lot of money to buy the game multiple times for multiple accounts.

There are some categories in Category Extensions that comes close to simulating a New Game experience, you can check the leaderboards [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_woa_extensions/leaderboards). Click on "Default Loadout/Start (NG)" or "Default Loadout/Start (NG+)" and then click "View Rules" if confused about the rules.

- "Default Loadout/Start (NG)" is a category for playing the game like you would on the first playthrough, but with zero unlocking of items/ features allowed.
- "Default Loadout/Start (NG+)" is a category that allows for some minimal NG+ features.

## Q: Okay, say I'm willing to try the NG+ categories, how do I level up quickly to get the item and starting location unlocks?

A: First of all, if you are PC, consider using [Peacock](https://thepeacockproject.org/wiki/intel/). This tool will allow you to get access to all unlocks right away.

If you are on console or do not wish to use Peacock, take a look at [this list of unlocks](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2725872637) first, so you know what you need to do to get a certain item.

In general, to level up mastery you should first get The Classics challenges (SASO, Sniper Assassin) done first, as you can get many challenges done in one run. Note that for the most part, **any other challenge besides The Classics do not require you to finish the level to get XP**.

Thus, for other challenges, the most efficient way to get XP is to make a save right before critical points in a run, such as after you have a target isolated. Then you can load the save multiple times to complete multiple challenges. Note that the mastery level can take a while to update if you don't finish the mission, go to Career->Mastery from main menu to get a more accurate look at your current mastery level. Note that if you dislike the in game challenges, you technically can get XP just by playing the game normally, it will just take way longer to level up.

## Q: What are the optimal in-game settings to run the game?

A: Go to Options> Gameplay > HUD. Turn on Difficulty HUD (for verification purposes), Silent Assassin HUD (to see what rating you have at all times), Timer HUD (helps for timing certain kills). For Miami, you may also want to turn Simulation Quality in Graphics Settings to Base, to avoid rendering some racetrack flags.

## Q: What are the best keybinds (for PC)?

A: Keybinds are mostly just personal preference, but here are some things to consider:

- Remember you can have secondary keybinds for most actions in the game. You can for instance have inventory bound to both a mouse button and a key on your keyboard.
- It is highly recommended to rebind Inventory to a mouse button, or at least a key more easily accessible to the left hand on the keyboard than the "I" key. You need to be able to interact with Inventory at a moment's notice for [fast interact](fast_anim#fast-interact).
- It is highly recommended to rebind the drop/crouch/unpack buttons (perhaps as secondary keybinds), to facillitate [fast unpack](guns#fast-sniper-briefcase-unpack). Suggestions: have these three actions bound to 1/2/3 or Z/X/C so that all three buttons are right next to each other.

## Q: How do I set up Livesplit for full game runs?

A: You can use one of the following livesplit methods

- [Peacock Autosplitter](https://hitruns-wiki.vercel.app/docs/livesplit_peacock) - Most accurate autosplitter and easiest to use, but requires installation of [Peacock](https://thepeacockproject.org/wiki/intel/). Works on both Steam and Epic.

- [Official Servers Autosplitter](https://hitruns-wiki.vercel.app/docs/livesplit_auto_official) - As the name implies, this works on official servers (Epic Only). **May be out of date / no longer working**. It is generally less accurate than the Peacock Autosplitter.

- [Manual Splitter](https://hitruns-wiki.vercel.app/docs/livesplit_manual) - Very accurate and works on all platforms / server versions. However it is a bit cumbersome to use.

## Q: I'm new, what categories are there?

A: There is the [Main Leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_woa), [Category Extensions Leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_woa_extensions), [Escalations Leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_woa_escalations), [Elusive Target Leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_woa_ets).

- For new players, SA/SO on the Main Leaderboard is suggested. Start with a level you like playing casually.

## Q: How significant is the difference between Pro and Master Difficulty?

A: It really depends on the map and category you are running. On many maps and categories, Pro vs Master makes absolutely no difference. It is common for new players to mistakenly think Master adds more features than it actually does. More details are given below:

### Global Changes (Affects All Maps)

- NPC's will see farther
  - This makes randomized headturns more significant, as the NPC will be more likely to see you if they swing their head in your direction
  - This also makes [NPC panics](guns#triple-shot-panic) spread more quickly, which can sometimes be a good thing depending on the context
- NPC's will hear footsteps if you run, which includes crouch running
  - Note: NPC hearing range for footsteps is **random**, and using footstep sounds to intentionally distract an NPC as a stealth tactic is not reliable at all
  - It is quite disappointing how one of the only unique gameplay changes from Master is randomized and difficult to use to the player's advantage
- NPC's will take less damage from bullets, as [shown here](guns#miscellaneous-gun-stats-from-muddye)

### Map-Specific Changes

- Extra NPC Enforcers and Cameras may be added to some maps on Master difficulty
- For Season 1 and 2 maps (Paris to Sgail, Not including the DLC maps of New York / Haven / Ambrose), items on the map may be in different locations between Pro and Master difficulty
  - Note that any changed Master difficulty item placements are not tracked by [HITMAPS](https://www.hitmaps.com/)

## Q: I am having trouble with X trick/ have a question about the leaderboard rules, can anyone help me?

A: For general advice, consider reading the [other guides](https://hitruns-wiki.vercel.app/docs/index) first.
